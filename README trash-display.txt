Trash-display is used as a simple gui to see the ip address of your gateway. 
LCDPROC is a better program to use for these displays. 

as of version 1.0 trash-display does not work with wifi adapters. 

You will need the Matrix Orbital program "Mogd Sharp" to import your own 192 x 64 pixel bitmap files into the display. Trash-display does not contain the images, it just tells the display to show whatever is loaded into the specific locations of the display memory.
