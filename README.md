The trash-gateway is collection of projects that help repurpose and utilize equipment that is commonly thrown into the trash at the companay I work for. 
The computers are part of a system infrastructure product and consist of a rack mountable chassis, a Matrix Orbital display with keypad, usually an Atom based 
motherboard (NF96FL-525-LF), a HDD, and 2GB of DDR2 800 RAM.

These units are covered under maintenance contracts so when they have an issue, they're tossed and replaced. Usually it's a bad HDD, or a bad motherboard, or damaged from shipping. 
It usualy takes two or three of these to make one working unit, but what I'm left with is a great platform for learning Linux, programming, IoT projects, 2-way Radio interfaces, and robotics projects. 

I install a new SSD, insert a second stick of RAM (giving me 4GB), and load either Debian or Rocky linux depending on the need. 

The trash-gateway is a personal project for exploring and learning, and is about 95% full of beginner mistakes. The idea is to make these all work together to form one platform, and helpo me understand and build scalable solutions with various cloud services.
